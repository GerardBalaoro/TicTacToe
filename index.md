## Game Play

- **Classic Mode**
    - The TicTacToe game we all know and love.
- **Flip Mode**
    - TicTacToe with a flipping twist! It is played on a 4x4 board. At the beginning of each player's turn, they have to *flip* one of their opponents piece to any adjacent blank space to it. The color of the piece changes and it will be treated as a different tile.
    - To win, players must form a line of 3 *unflippable* pieces. Except during *flipping*, when if it forms a line of 3, the player whose piece it is wins the game.


## Features

- **Game Saves**
    - Players have the option to save one of their games, and load it in a latter time. Saving a new game overwrites old saves.
- **In-Game Info Boxes**
    - The game provides helpful information about the game play and the game's features throughout the game.
- **Undo Last Move**
    - Each player, at the end of their turn, has the option to *undo* their moves.
